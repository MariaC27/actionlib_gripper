# actionlib_gripper
An actionlib server and client that takes a string ('open' or 'close') as a request and uses an if statement to return true or false as the response. This is an intermediate step to the eventual goal of using the URX libraries to move the robot based on the request of the gripper to move to the open or closed position. Summer Research 2019 at Tufts University.
